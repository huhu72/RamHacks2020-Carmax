# The Problem

On carmax.com, given more and more customers are starting their vehicle buying journey online, with over 35k vehicles within our inventory, how do we visually help users narrow down the vehicles by transfer fee?
Transfer fee is the cost customers can pay to move a vehicle from one location to another. Fees can vary from FREE to $2000.

# What We Learned

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# How We Built It
Within the 24 hour period, we were able to build a mock website of CarMax by taking some images off the original website and pieced together our solution implementing using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then we uploaded our code to be hosted on surge.

# Challenges We Faced

Due to the complexity of how the website is designed, it was hard to replicate some of the features so to save time, we just hardcoded the design. Since CarMax doesn't provide an API for their data, we just took screen shots to mimic what it would look like.
